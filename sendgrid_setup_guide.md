# Twilio SendGrid Setup Guide

This guide details the steps to set up a Twilio SendGrid account, verify your sending identity, generate a secure API Key, and configure it for the Clahan Academy assessment system.

## Step 1: Sign Up & Verify Sender Identity

1. **Create an Account**:
   * Navigate to [sendgrid.com](https://sendgrid.com/) and sign up for a free or transactional plan (the free tier includes 100 emails/day).
2. **Sender Authentication**:
   * Before SendGrid allows you to send emails, you must verify your identity. In the SendGrid dashboard, go to **Settings > Sender Authentication**.
   * Choose one of the two options:
     * **Single Sender Verification** (Easiest for testing): Verify a single email address (e.g., `noreply@yourdomain.com`). SendGrid sends a validation email to this address containing a confirmation link.
     * **Domain Authentication** (Recommended for production): Verify your entire DNS domain (e.g., adding MX/TXT records to your domain provider). This signs emails with DKIM/SPF, preventing them from landing in spam folders.

## Step 2: Generate a SendGrid API Key

1. Log into the SendGrid dashboard.
2. Go to **Settings > API Keys** on the left menu.
3. Click the **Create API Key** button in the top right.
4. Fill in the details:
   * **API Key Name**: `Clahan Academy Notification Service`
   * **API Key Permissions**:
     * Select **Restricted Access** (Recommended for security).
     * Scroll down to **Mail Send** and slide it to **Full Access**. (Leave other settings disabled to prevent leak risks).
5. Click **Create & View**.
6. **Copy the generated key immediately** (starts with `SG.`). SendGrid will only display it once for security reasons.

## Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

You must supply the API key and verified sender email to the `notification-service`.

### Option A: Local Dev Configuration

If you run the microservices locally via `npm run dev`:

1. Create or open the `.env` file in the **`notification-service`** directory.
2. Add the following lines:

   ```env
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your_actual_api_key_here
   SENDGRID_FROM=your_verified_sender_email@domain.com
   ```

3. Restart the `notification-service` server.

### Option B: Docker Compose Configuration

If you deploy using `docker-compose.yml`:

1. Open a terminal on your host machine.
2. Set the environment variables on the host system:
   * **Windows (PowerShell)**:

     ```powershell
     $env:SENDGRID_API_KEY="SG.your_actual_api_key_here"
     $env:SENDGRID_FROM="your_verified_sender_email@domain.com"
     ```

   * **Windows (CMD)**:

     ```cmd
     set SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your_actual_api_key_here
     set SENDGRID_FROM=your_verified_sender_email@domain.com
     ```

   * **Linux/macOS**:

     ```bash
     export SENDGRID_API_KEY="SG.your_actual_api_key_here"
     export SENDGRID_FROM="your_verified_sender_email@domain.com"
     ```

3. Launch the container stack:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build -d
   ```

   Docker Compose will automatically inject these variables into the `notification-service` container as configured.

## Step 4: Verification & Logs

1. Register a new user on the frontend or trigger an OTP resend.
2. Check the logs of `notification-service`:
   * Successful delivery will log: `[SendGrid] Email dispatched successfully to student@domain.com`
   * Visit **`http://localhost:4006/api/notifications/logs`** to verify delivery receipts.

## Removing Authenticated Domains (Client Handover)

If you authenticate a domain during development or staging and need to remove it later (e.g., when returning the domain to your client):

1. **Delete from SendGrid**:
   * Log in to the SendGrid Dashboard.
   * Go to **Settings > Sender Authentication**.
   * Under **Domain Authentication**, select the domain and click **Delete**.

2. **Remove DNS Records**:
   * Log in to the domain registrar or DNS host (e.g., GoDaddy, Cloudflare, Namecheap).
   * Delete the CNAME / TXT / MX records that you added during the verification process.

Once both steps are done, SendGrid will no longer be authorized to send emails on behalf of that domain, and the domain will be fully reverted to its original state.
